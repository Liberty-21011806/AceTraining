# AceTraining

***Satisfactory Website***

[]Ace Training requires a new system for students that **enrol onto their courses**. 
[]There are three user types: Student, Tutor and Admin. 
[]All three can enrol themselves, but **students require authorisation from a tutor** before they are fully registered. 
[]**All user types log in using the same form**. (It is possible that tutors might need authorisation by the admin.)
[]There is a **database in the backend** that stores all the data about users (and other relevant things), and the website connects to this database when it needs to update or view this information. 
[]In addition, the **website is reasonably secure**; for example a student cannot access pages specific to a tutor.

***Good Website***
Ace Training has a simplistic version of Moodle, i.e. a virtual learning environment. 

[]The tutor has the ability to upload various resources to this facility, such as slides and documents. 
[]Students can access these by downloading them. 
[]There is also a facility for the tutor upload text files that will be automatically interpreted by the website to interactive quizzes, such as simple multiple choice quizzes.
[x]The tutor and/or admin can create new courses on the system, 
  []and students can enrol onto those courses. 
[x]Enrolments must be authorised by the tutor before they become valid.
