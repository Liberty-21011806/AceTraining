#Satisfactory Website
Ace Training requires a new system for students that **enrol onto their courses**. There are three user types: Student, Tutor and Admin. All three can enrol
themselves, but **students require authorisation from a tutor** before they are fully registered. **All user types log in using the same form**. (It is possible that
tutors might need authorisation by the admin.)
There is a **database in the backend** that stores all the data about users (and other relevant things), and the website connects to this database when it needs
to update or view this information. In addition, the **website is reasonably secure**; for example a student cannot access pages specific to a tutor.
